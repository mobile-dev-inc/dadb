A Kotlin/Java library to connect directly to an Android device without an adb binary or an ADB server

```kotlin
dependencies {
  implementation("dev.mobile:dadb:<version>")
}
```

### Example Usage

Connect to `emulator-5554` and install `apkFile`:

```kotlin
Dadb.create("localhost", 5555).use { dadb ->
    dadb.install(apkFile)
}
```

*Note: Connect to the odd adb daemon port (5555), not the even emulator console port (5554)*

### Discover a Device

The following discovers and returns a connected device or emulator. If there are multiple it returns the first one found.

```kotlin
val dadb = Dadb.discover()
if (dadb == null) throw RuntimeException("No adb device found")
```

Use the following API if you want to list all available devices:

```kotlin
val dadbs = Dadb.list()
```

### Connecting to a physical device

*Prerequisite: Connecting to a physical device requires a running adb server. In most cases, this means that you must have the `adb` binary installed on your machine.*

The `Dadb.discover()` and `Dadb.list()` methods now both support USB-connected devices.

```kotlin
// Both of these will include any USB-connected devices if they are available
val dadb = Dadb.discover()
val dadbs = Dadb.list()
```

If you'd like to connect directly to a physical device via its serial number. Use the following API:

```kotlin
val dadb = AdbServer.createDadb(
    adbServerHost = "localhost",
    adbServerPort = 5037,
    deviceQuery = "host:transport:${serialNumber}"
)
```

### Install / Uninstall APK

```kotlin
dadb.install(exampleApkFile)
dadb.uninstall("com.example.app")
```

### Push / Pull Files

```kotlin
dadb.push(srcFile, "/data/local/tmp/dst.txt")
dadb.pull(dstFile, "/data/local/tmp/src.txt")
```

### Execute Shell Command

```kotlin
val response = dadb.shell("echo hello")
assert(response.exitCode == 0)
assert(response.output == "hello\n")
```

### TCP Forwarding

```kotlin
dadb.tcpForward(
    hostPort = 7001,
    targetPort = 7001
).use {
    // localhost:7001 is now forwarded to device's 7001 port
    // Do operations that depend on port forwarding
}
```

### Authentication

**Dadb will use your adb key at `~/.android/adbkey` by default. If none exists at this location, private and public keys will be generated by dadb.**

If you need to specify a custom path to your adb key, use the optional `keyPair` argument:

```kotlin
val adbKeyPair = AdbKeyPair.read(privateKeyFile, publicKeyFile)
Dadb.create("localhost", 5555, adbKeyPair)
```
